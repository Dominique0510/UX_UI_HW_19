        <h2>UX/UI Designer</h2>

        <p>As a recent graduate from the University of Denver's UX/UI bootcamp,
            I have become a passionate, creative and detail obsessed UX/UI designer.

            I have learned to utilize my intuition and insight in order to fully
            understand my users point of views and aim to accomplish user-oriented
            designs that highlight empathy and accessibility. I love asking questions in
            order to grow and I always embrace new challenges.

            Because of this bootcamp, I now have strengths in UX Research,
            Visual Design and Mobile and Web Design. </p>

            <h2>Outboulder Desktop & Mobile Redesign</h2>
            <p>Outboulder is a Non profit Organization who
                helps the LGBTQ+ Community feel included,
                shares volunteer opportunities, showcases
                upcoming events, and so much more! During
                our research, we discovered that many of our
                Users had a difficult time navigating through
                the website and felt very overwhelmed with
                the amount of information provided. Please
                click on “View Case Study” to view our

            <h2> Federal Trade Commission Homepage Redesign</h2>
            <p>The Federal Trade Commission is a
                valuable website to utilize if users ever
                experience fraud or identity theft. During
                user testing, we discovered that the majority
                of them felt very overwhelmed with all the
                information on the website, wanted the
                navigation bar to be condensed, and overall
                wanted to have a more calming feel when
                navigated through the website!</p>

            <h2>RAAD MOBILE REDESIGN</h2>
            <p>My group and I wanted to create a one-stop
                for any “Do It Yourself” craft lovers! When
                conducting our research, we discovered that
                our users find it frustrating that there aren’t
                any DIY apps that focus on their individual
                learning styles and how they wish they could
                purchase the materials needed for their
                projects straight from the app.</p>
