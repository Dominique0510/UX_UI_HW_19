        <h2>UX/UI Designer</h2>
    
        <p>As a recent graduate from the University of Denver's UX/UI bootcamp,
            I have become a passionate, creative and detail obsessed UX/UI designer.
            
            I have learned to utilize my intuition and insight in order to fully 
            understand my users point of views and aim to accomplish user-oriented 
            designs that highlight empathy and accessibility. I love asking questions in
            order to grow and I always embrace new challenges. 
            
            Because of this bootcamp, I now have strengths in UX Research, 
            Visual Design and Mobile and Web Design. </p>

            <p>Outboulder is a Non profit Organization who 
                helps the LGBTQ+ Community feel included,
                shares volunteer opportunities, showcases 
                upcoming events, and so much more! During 
                our research, we discovered that many of our
                Users had a difficult time navigating through 
                the website and felt very overwhelmed with 
                the amount of information provided. Please
                click on “View Case Study” to view our 
                redesign!</p>

                <p>The Federal Trade Commission is a
                    valuable website to utilize if users ever
                    experience fraud or identity theft. During
                    user testing, we discovered that the majority
                    of them felt very overwhelmed with all the
                    information on the website, wanted the
                    navigation bar to be condensed, and overall
                    wanted to have a more calming feel when
                    navigated through the website!</p>

                    <p>My group and I wanted to create a one-stop
                        for any “Do It Yourself” craft lovers! When
                        conducting our research, we discovered that
                        our users find it frustrating that there aren’t
                        any DIY apps that focus on their individual
                        learning styles and how they wish they could
                        purchase the materials needed for their 
                        projects straight from the app.</p>
